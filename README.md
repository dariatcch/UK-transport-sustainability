# Strategic Mobility Analytics: Transforming UK Transportation Networks for Net-Zero Achievement

## Overview

This project investigates how user behaviour across different modes of transportation in the UK — and external factors such as weather and congestion — can inform policies that support the UK’s Net-Zero carbon emissions goals.

We address the central question:
Can understanding transportation user behaviour in the UK help in formulating policies to encourage the UK’s Net-Zero goals?

Using data on road traffic, cycling, tube and rail usage, weather, and $CO_2$ emissions, we conduct exploratory and statistical analyses to uncover trends, interconnections, and implications for policy design.

## Key Findings
* Cars and taxis are consistently the largest contributors to $CO_2$ emissions across all UK regions.
* Cycling is more common on weekdays than weekends, and lowest during winter in London.
* Tube and rail congestion has little effect on usage, highlighting their critical and indispensable role in England’s transport network.
* Strong interconnections exist across transportation modes, with similar stations showing similar usage patterns.

## Policy Recommendations
* Encourage cycling on weekends and in winter through targeted infrastructure and campaigns.
* Enhance tube/rail service planning and capacity to address future demand and prevent bottlenecks.
* Develop regional strategies that reflect urban–rural differences in transportation behaviours.
* Prioritise carbon reduction in cars and taxis through incentives for low-emission vehicles and modal integration.
